# Audit remediation — 2026-09-26

## Scope and resume contract

This is the single execution record for the engineering audit of HEAD
`2eb8173211a90eb45335617839f9d5a5b5e9497d` (v0.3.0). Baseline: branch
`main`, clean working tree, no user changes. All 17 audit findings below are
accepted; the conditional USG-06 finding is accepted as a reconciliation/diagnostic
task, not as proof that every real log loses tokens.

**Current status: complete.** All 17 findings are verified in the
[per-finding outcome table](#per-finding-outcome), which owns their current
statuses and verification evidence. The registry below preserves the original
problems and acceptance criteria. [Validation limits](#validation-limits)
record checks and guarantees outside that acceptance; they are not claimed as
passed.

The external audit is not required to continue: evidence, decisions, acceptance,
dependencies and verification are recorded here. Do not expand this work to
unrelated roadmap items, change model routing, add paid live benchmarks, rewrite
historical releases, or weaken permission defaults.

The audit's unnumbered future options are not accepted implementation work:
there is no measured scan-latency problem to justify an index/cache, the four
bundles need an equality test rather than a DSL, and automatic model/release
updates lack a chosen compatibility policy. A paid benchmark platform has no
established need and requires separate cost authority. Crash recovery after
SIGKILL/power loss and protection against a hostile racing process need a
separately defined guarantee; the transaction here handles normal failures and
observed concurrent edits. Extra ROADMAP/ARCHITECTURE files would duplicate this
plan and the development guide. These decisions use the audit's evidence, not
the low priority or former deferred label.

**Goal:** Complete all applicable findings INS-01/02, USG-01 through USG-08,
QA-01/02, AGT-01/02, PLAN-01, DOC-01 and MAINT-01 in
`/home/snaplyze/codex-orchestrator`, using this file as the authoritative plan
and finding registry. Continue through every queue; a documentation phase, a
passing subset or an empty short Todo is not completion. Preserve user changes,
use isolated fixtures, keep implementation/docs/tests consistent, and finish only
after all acceptance criteria pass or a finding is proved inapplicable. Record
unavailable external verification as incomplete, never as passed. Do not publish,
deploy, incur model charges or perform irreversible actions without applicable
authorization. Continue this same goal after compaction, reading AGENTS.md and
this execution record first.

Goal mechanism: native `create_goal/get_goal/update_goal` is available; initial
`get_goal` returned no active goal. Activation must follow the documentation gate.
Activated goal identifier (thread ID):
`01a0dd09-2476-74b0-a945-b7ce6b954541` (the native tool returns a thread ID,
not a separate goal ID). Activation confirmed by create_goal after D0.

## Architecture and validation boundaries

Ready-to-copy `profiles/*` are the distribution source. Their TOML files own model,
effort and permission settings; their identical skills own shared routing policy.
At baseline, root AGENTS.md served both source maintainers and installed projects.
The baseline installers validated a selected bundle, confirmed updates, backed up
components, copied files, migrated the old skill and updated a managed block.
Current transaction behavior is documented in the README and migration guide.
The Python stdlib CLI groups Codex rollout JSONL and renders usage. It is not a
billing system. Tests use unittest; baseline CI ran Python 3.12 on Ubuntu and
Windows, preferring pwsh on Windows. Native Codex/account access is separate
from static TOML validity.

Sources used by the audit:
[Codex custom agents](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents#custom-agents),
[skill discovery](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills#where-codex-loads-local-skills),
[protocol rust-v0.157.1](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/rust-v0.157.1/codex-rs/protocol/src/protocol.rs),
[GitHub Node 24 migration](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-09-23-node-20-is-no-longer-available-in-github-actions/).
Recheck version-sensitive decisions against primary sources. Do not infer paid
account access or live-model quality from these sources.

Baseline audit evidence: 34 unittest tests passed (23 installers, 3 profiles,
8 usage); shell syntax and ShellCheck passed; published CI run 36233983873
passed both jobs. These results describe the baseline, not future edits.

## Finding registry

These entries describe the audit baseline and the accepted remediation. Their
final statuses are recorded in the [outcome table](#per-finding-outcome); they
are not a queue of pending work.

### INS-01 — hardlinks escape target write boundaries (P2; defect)

- Evidence: shell copy and PowerShell Copy-Item overwrite existing inodes.
  A config hardlinked to an external sentinel changes that sentinel; cancellation
  restores only the target. Reproduced in both engines on Linux.
- Decision: stage replacement files and replace directory entries; protect
  AGENTS writes too. Preserve required file metadata; reject incompatible paths.
  Do not add a runtime dependency merely to detect hardlinks.
- Components/docs: setup.sh, setup.ps1, tests/test_installers.py, README.md,
  guides/migration.md, guides/development.md.
- Dependencies: shared transaction design with INS-02.
- Acceptance/check: external hardlinked config and AGENTS stay byte-identical on
  success and rollback; normal install/update/migration pass on each supported
  engine; targeted hardlink regression tests plus full installer suite.

### INS-02 — component rollback erases concurrent user work (P2; defect)

- Evidence: approve .codex, wait at the next prompt, edit an unrelated user file
  and create another, then EOF. Both installers restore the old file and delete
  the new one because rollback removes the whole component.
- Decision: journal only touched paths, with before/installed states. Restore
  only unchanged installer-owned output; retain/report conflicting user changes
  and recovery data. Never recursively delete an existing component to roll back.
  Account for legacy skill moves and newly created directories.
- Components/docs: same as INS-01.
- Dependencies: common safe-write helper from INS-01.
- Acceptance/check: unrelated concurrent edits/new files survive; modified
  managed files produce a recovery warning and preserved backup; failed restores
  retain usable data; equivalent deterministic cancellation/failure tests for
  shell and PowerShell. An installer lock alone cannot satisfy this criterion.

### USG-01 — independent limit events are skipped (P2; defect)

- Evidence: token_count info=null makes the parser continue before rate_limits;
  snapshots 10%,20%,30% render 20%→20%. Official info and rate_limits are optional
  independently.
- Decision: parse limits independently from usage.
- Components/docs: scripts/token_usage.py, tests/test_token_usage.py,
  guides/token-usage.md. Dependencies: none.
- Acceptance/check: rate-only first/last events render 10%→30%; usage stays 100;
  regression fixture exercises the public report path.

### USG-02 — date-limited reports look complete (P2; contract mismatch)

- Evidence: root day 25=100 tokens, child day 26=200; --date day25 reports 100,
  without date 300. Help says date limits files, guide promises full session cost.
- Decision: preserve the date filter semantics; expose scan scope and incomplete
  coverage explicitly in Markdown/JSON and docs. Full-session examples omit date.
- Components/docs: usage CLI/tests, README.md, guides/token-usage.md.
- Dependencies: shared diagnostics/metadata with USG-03.
- Acceptance/check: filtered output is unmistakably partial; unfiltered fixture
  totals 300; JSON records scope and limitations. Do not imply an unfiltered
  directory proves all possible logs exist.

### USG-03 — malformed boundary data crashes reporting (P2; defect)

- Evidence: naive/aware timestamps, id=null with valid session_id, primary=42,
  infinite counters and bad UTF-8 each cause uncaught exceptions.
- Decision: validate identities/nested counters/windows, normalize timestamps,
  isolate read/decoding failures; surface warnings and partial status instead of
  silently converting corrupt data to authoritative zero.
- Components/docs: usage CLI/tests and token guide. Dependencies: none.
- Acceptance/check: all five corrupt cases avoid traceback; valid data remains
  reportable or a clear nonzero error is returned; diagnostics distinguish partial
  results. Include unavailable/disappearing input in the same boundary policy.

### USG-04 — legacy root identity is inconsistent (P3; defect)

- Evidence: collect uses session_id or id, thread_role requires both equal;
  legacy root becomes unknown and loses cwd/version/quota summary.
- Decision: share root fallback, retaining explicit subagent identity precedence.
- Components/docs: usage CLI/tests, token guide. Depends: USG-03 metadata policy.
- Acceptance/check: missing-session_id root receives root summary; child/guardian
  roles remain correct. Official legacy deserializer uses id as fallback.

### USG-05 — accepted dates are not canonicalized (P3; defect)

- Evidence: strptime accepts 2026-9-25, filesystem scan uses 2026/9/25 rather than
  existing 2026/09/25.
- Decision: return canonical ISO date from validation.
- Components/docs: usage CLI/tests, token guide. Dependencies: none.
- Acceptance/check: padded/unpadded dates select identical files; invalid
  calendar dates remain argparse errors.

### USG-06 — mixed counters can disagree silently (P2; conditional risk)

- Evidence: cumulative 100, delta 200, cumulative 300 yields response total 200.
  Real resume/upgrade prevalence was not established.
- Decision: retain per-response totals and cumulative evidence separately; expose
  mismatch/coverage status without guessing model attribution or adding both.
  Check official writer semantics before claiming any stronger reconciliation.
- Components/docs: usage CLI/tests, token guide. Depends: USG-03, USG-08.
- Acceptance/check: mixed fixture emits explicit mismatch; legacy-only and
  response-only values stay correct; no automatic double-counting; JSON preserves
  evidence needed to interpret the diagnostic.

### USG-07 — quota windows/reset labels are inaccurate (P3; defect)

- Evidence: window_minutes=60/1440 still prints 5h/7d; resets_at change is omitted.
  Official snapshot provides duration/reset/limit identity.
- Decision: show actual durations or unknown; warn when resets/limit identity
  make snapshots incomparable. Do not turn arrows into asserted task cost.
- Components/docs: usage CLI/tests, README.md, token guide.
- Dependencies: USG-01/03.
- Acceptance/check: 60/1440 correctly labeled; reset and limit-id change warned;
  missing durations not guessed; normal 5h/7d snapshots remain readable.

### USG-08 — revert segments inflate thread counts (P3; defect)

- Evidence: official revert retains stable thread id in a new rollout; fixture
  root+child+replacement-child reports 3 threads/2 children, actually 2/1.
- Decision: count unique stable IDs and make multiple segments explicit; preserve
  all distinct response costs. Duplicate cost from inherited records was NOT
  established; writer filters inherited TokenUsageRecord at spawn.
- Components/docs: usage CLI/tests and token guide. Depends: USG-03 identity.
- Acceptance/check: fixture reports 2 threads/1 child and preserves 3 records,
  600 tokens; Markdown/JSON/list consistently distinguish thread and segment.

### QA-01 — platform/runtime verification gaps (P2; risk)

- Evidence: README supports macOS/Linux and Windows PowerShell; CI only
  Ubuntu/Windows, automatically preferring pwsh; three failure tests POSIX-only.
- Decision: explicit installer engine selection in test harness; matrix Linux sh,
  macOS sh, Windows pwsh and Windows PowerShell; portable rollback regression
  coverage. Document native Codex discovery smoke independently of paid calls.
- Components/docs: tests/test_installers.py, .github/workflows/ci.yml,
  guides/development.md, README.md, model-selection guide.
- Dependencies: INS-01/02 for final native acceptance; QA-02 action compatibility.
- Acceptance/check: full suite on every promised native engine, meaningful failure
  coverage on both installers, explicit evidence for loaded roles or documented
  manual smoke procedure. Unavailable native runners remain pending, not passed.

### QA-02 — forced Node runtime for old Actions (P3; risk)

- Evidence: checkout@v4/setup-python@v5 target Node20; successful audit CI warns
  both are forced onto Node24. This is NOT a broken-build finding.
- Decision: select reviewed supported Node24 action releases from first-party
  sources; retain Python3.12 and contents:read; pin reviewed immutable revisions
  if practical. No extra permissions.
- Components/docs: workflow, development guide. Dependencies: none.
- Acceptance/check: action metadata declares Node24; workflow validates and new
  native jobs succeed without forced-runtime warning.

### AGT-01 — source checkout lacks discoverable required skill (P3; mismatch)

- Evidence: AGENTS requires codex-orchestrator, only profiles/*/agents/skills holds
  it; standard discovery does not scan templates; self-install is forbidden.
- Decision: explicit maintainer fallback path and local plan/testing instructions
  outside the distributed managed block. Fresh installation must copy only that
  managed block, like updates, to avoid leaking maintainer rules into clients.
- Components/docs: AGENTS.md, installer/tests, README.md, development guide.
- Dependencies: safe installer write changes.
- Acceptance/check: clean checkout instruction resolves without global skill;
  new target contains managed client guidance but no maintainer plan/rules;
  existing unmanaged text and managed updates remain idempotent.

### AGT-02 — carry authority explicitly in briefs (P3; improvement)

- Evidence: existing brief specifies files/constraints but not task mode or
  external action permissions; read-only research text only bans application edits.
- Decision: add mode, permitted write surface/external effects and inherited
  authorization to brief/role instructions. No new permissions and no repeated
  approval for already authorized work.
- Components/docs: all four skill copies, role developer_instructions, AGENTS.md.
- Dependencies: none; role TOML changes follow documentation gate.
- Acceptance/check: audit-only, authorized commit and unauthorized publish
  examples route correctly; role settings unchanged; scope/permission checks.

### PLAN-01 — benchmark lacks outcome/initial-state controls (P3; improvement)

- Evidence: protocol/table record tokens/time/quota but no success criteria or
  reset to identical source state.
- Decision: define acceptance before runs, exact source revision, isolated trial
  checkout, cache/session assumptions, pass/partial/fail and successful-run cost.
- Components/docs: guides/token-usage.md. Depends: trustworthy metrics for live use.
- Acceptance/check: protocol can reproduce one trial; failed work cannot count as
  a cheaper success. No live paid benchmark is part of this remediation.

### DOC-01 — cache proportion does not establish monetary savings (P3; improvement)

- Evidence: 96% cached input is used to assert >10x cost overstatement without
  price weights; allowance/token mapping is acknowledged unknown elsewhere.
- Decision: state measured cache fraction, not a derived billing multiplier;
  monetary estimates require model/tier/date/rates/formula, not plan inference.
- Components/docs: token guide. Dependencies: none.
- Acceptance/check: no unsupported factor remains; historical sample retained.

### MAINT-01 — shared policy identity is not enforced (P3; improvement)

- Evidence: four identical skills; tests check names, models and concurrency but
  not identical skill bodies.
- Decision: add a small equality invariant, no generator/dependency.
- Components/docs: tests/test_profiles.py, development guide.
- Dependencies: AGT-02 skill edits.
- Acceptance/check: intentional model/concurrency differences pass; one-profile
  accidental skill divergence fails the invariant.

## Ordered Todo and ownership

- [x] D0 Documentation gate: registry, current limitations, development/agent rules,
  benchmark correction, linked entrypoint; docs-only diff reviewed.
- [x] G0 Activate the native goal; save returned status/identifier here.
- [x] I1 Implement INS-01/02 and installer half of AGT-01 with regression tests.
- [x] U1 Implement USG-01..08 with explicit scope, diagnostics and segment semantics.
- [x] Q1 Implement QA-01/02 and MAINT-01; verify supported runtime documentation.
- [x] A1 Complete AGT-01/02, test client/source instruction separation.
- [x] D1 Synchronize final README/guides with actual behavior and PLAN-01/DOC-01.
- [x] V1 Independent review, focused regressions, full checks and docs gate.
- [x] R1 Reconcile every ID; obtain required external runner evidence if missing;
  only then mark applicable items and goal complete.

I1 and U1 may run concurrently with disjoint file ownership after G0.
Root owns planning/docs/CI/integration. Installer worker owns both installers and
installer tests. Usage worker owns analyzer and its tests. Shared acceptance
changes require root coordination. No worker may publish or edit global settings.

## Verification commands and review focus

Local: `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -v`,
`sh -n setup.sh`, `shellcheck setup.sh`. PowerShell: parse setup.ps1 with its
Language.Parser, then run tests through explicit engine selection.
CI: Python3.12 on supported native platforms. Docs: relative link/anchor check
and commands/examples against current code. No Mermaid changes are required.

Review focus: hardlinks in config/AGENTS; unrelated and managed concurrent writes;
rollback failure/recovery retention; legacy skill archive conflicts; malformed
usage values and disappearing files; cross-day scope; repeated stable thread IDs;
unsupported assumptions about live model access and native platform success.

## Execution checkpoint — final reconciliation

All **17 findings are implemented and verified**. No numbered finding is deferred,
blocked or closed merely by documentation. The native goal was activated after
the documentation gate and completed after final branch/clean-tree verification
at `2415e848838147a4819532fdbcf7d42e448e941e` and successful
[CI run 36238626888](https://github.com/snaplyze/codex-orchestrator/actions/runs/36238626888).

Implementation branch: `fix/audit-remediation`, based on clean `main` at
`2eb8173211a90eb45335617839f9d5a5b5e9497d`. There were no pre-existing user
changes. Reviewed code and tests are published at
`02b8988d0fd0192c26ab2597922f04099f4d5554`; the final documentation commit records
this reconciliation, README layout and Unreleased changelog without changing code.
That remediation stage ended before the authorized release and merge into main;
publication and branch cleanup are recorded below.

### Per-finding outcome

| ID | Result | Verification evidence |
|---|---|---|
| INS-01 | Verified | Config and AGENTS hardlink regressions pass on all four native jobs; independent cancellation probe preserves the external sentinel and 0600 mode. |
| INS-02 | Verified | Concurrent managed/unrelated edits and deletions, failed writes/restores, archive conflicts and link substitutions preserve user data or retain actionable recovery copies. All native installer suites pass. |
| USG-01 | Verified | Rate-only first/last events report 10%→30% while response usage stays 100. |
| USG-02 | Verified | Cross-day fixture reports explicit date-filtered partial scope; unfiltered observed usage is 300. JSON retains unknown directory coverage. |
| USG-03 | Verified | Corrupt identities, timestamps, nested fields, record types, non-finite values, UTF-8 and disappearing files are diagnosed without losing following valid usage. |
| USG-04 | Verified | Legacy root fallback covers non-CLI sources while child/guardian source identity keeps precedence. |
| USG-05 | Verified | Padded/unpadded dates select the same files; invalid and oversized dates produce CLI errors. |
| USG-06 | Verified | Mixed totals and component-only disagreements emit diagnostics, preserve cumulative evidence and never add both accounting sources. |
| USG-07 | Verified | Real window durations and changed reset/limit identities are visible; multi-segment quota summaries identify their selected root segment. |
| USG-08 | Verified | Stable-thread fixture counts 2 threads/1 child across 3 segments, retaining 600 tokens; list, JSON and Markdown agree. |
| QA-01 | Verified | 56 tests pass on Linux sh, macOS sh, Windows pwsh and Windows PowerShell 5.1, with zero skipped tests. Native Codex discovery smoke is documented separately. |
| QA-02 | Verified | Reviewed Node24 action pins, actionlint and all native jobs pass; logs contain no forced/deprecated Node20 notice. |
| AGT-01 | Verified | Maintainer fallback resolves the bundled skill; fresh installs receive only managed client instructions. Existing text/CRLF/idempotence and prompt-time edits are covered. |
| AGT-02 | Verified | Independent instruction review covers audit-only, authorized commit and unauthorized publish scenarios. Models, efforts, sandbox settings and existing authority remain unchanged. |
| PLAN-01 | Verified | Reviewed protocol specifies acceptance, exact source revision, isolated trials, cache assumptions, outcomes, repeats and successful-run comparison. No paid benchmark was required. |
| DOC-01 | Verified | Cache fraction is retained as an observation; unsupported monetary multiplier removed. API pricing and subscription allowance are distinguished. |
| MAINT-01 | Verified | Four profile tests pass; isolated one-profile mutation produces exactly one expected equality assertion failure. |

### Checks and revisions

[Successful native CI run 36238401247](https://github.com/snaplyze/codex-orchestrator/actions/runs/36238401247)
tested `02b8988d0fd0192c26ab2597922f04099f4d5554` with Python 3.12:

| Native job | Result |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu / sh | 56 passed, 0 skipped; shell syntax and ShellCheck passed |
| macOS / sh | 56 passed, 0 skipped; shell syntax passed |
| Windows / pwsh | 56 passed, 0 skipped; PowerShell parser passed |
| Windows / powershell | 56 passed, 0 skipped; Windows PowerShell parser passed |

Local Linux checks on the same implementation (before the isolated test-env
correction) used Python 3.13 and portable PowerShell 7.6.6:

```bash
TMPDIR=/home/snaplyze/.cache/codex-orchestrator-audit-tools/test-tmp \
CODEX_INSTALLER_TEST_ENGINE=sh PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
python3 -m unittest discover -v
# 56 passed

TMPDIR=/home/snaplyze/.cache/codex-orchestrator-audit-tools/test-tmp \
CODEX_INSTALLER_TEST_ENGINE=pwsh \
CODEX_INSTALLER_TEST_EXECUTABLE=/home/snaplyze/.cache/codex-orchestrator-pwsh-7.6.6/pwsh \
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest tests.test_installers -v
# 31 passed

sh -n setup.sh
shellcheck setup.sh
git diff --check
# All passed
```

The explicit temporary directory is private and executable; this host's /tmp is
noexec. The development guide gives portable commands without this machine's
paths. PowerShell Language.Parser reported no parse errors. Actionlint 1.7.12
passed the workflow. A relative path/anchor check passed all 30 local links in
17 Markdown files. PyYAML parsed four skill headers and tomllib parsed 20 roles.
The optional instruction linter lacked its frontmatter package; no project
dependency was added for it. Structural checks, policy invariant tests and
independent semantic review provide the recorded instruction evidence.

Three focused PowerShell tests covering all child-launch paths passed after the
test-environment correction; the native run above then passed the full suite.
All four native job logs were inspected for test summaries, skipped tests and
the former forced-Node20 warning. No private session logs or model API calls
were used.

### Decisions and review closure

- Documentation gate came first: README, AGENTS, migration/token guides, this
  registry and development guide were updated before any implementation, test,
  TOML or CI edit. All 17 IDs had acceptance and dependencies. Only then was the
  native goal activated and confirmed.
- Installer and usage work had disjoint worker ownership; root owned docs, rules,
  CI and integration. Independent reviewers examined installer safety, usage
  boundaries and instruction/CI consistency. All material findings were fixed.
- Review-driven regressions include stale AGENTS confirmation snapshots, deleted
  managed outputs, link substitutions during rollback and malformed JSON record
  types. The last parser failure was observed before its fix, then all 21 usage
  tests passed.
- Real installer I/O faults are injected by shell mv and PowerShell Copy-Item
  proxies. Marker assertions prove injection happened; they were not replaced by
  cancellation-only coverage. Recovery entries use `manifest.txt` (normalized
  relative path, then existing/new) plus before/after copies.
- First native [run 36238178006](https://github.com/snaplyze/codex-orchestrator/actions/runs/36238178006)
  passed Linux, macOS and Windows PS7 but failed PS5.1: Python inherited PS7's
  module paths and Get-FileHash could not autoload. Following
  [Microsoft's documented remedy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_psmodulepath#starting-windows-powershell-from-powershell-7),
  the harness now removes PSModulePath only from PowerShell test children.
  The installer and assertions were unchanged; independent review confirmed all
  three launch sites and preservation of other environment settings.
- checkout v7.0.1 is pinned to `3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1`;
  setup-python v7.0.0 to `5fda3b95a4ea91299a34e894583c3862153e4b97`.
  First-party action metadata declares node24. Python3.12 and contents:read are
  retained; checkout credential persistence is disabled.
- Shared skills remain identical without a generator; no new runtime or project
  dependency, model-routing change or permission expansion was introduced.
- The earlier explicit user authorization to push after review was used for this
  reviewed branch and native CI only. Publication was not inferred from agent
  delegation. Commits are ordinary, with no history rewriting.

### Validation limits

No audit finding remains open. Directory scanning cannot prove every rollout
exists, cumulative mismatches cannot establish an unobserved model attribution,
and quota snapshots cannot establish billed cost. Those are explicit output
contracts, not silently failed acceptance.

Native runner tests do not certify every filesystem ACL/junction policy or every
Windows/macOS version. Transaction checks cover normal failure and detected
concurrent changes, not forced-kill/power-loss recovery or a hostile filesystem
race. Account model access, fresh live Codex role/skill discovery and paid
quality benchmarks were not run; the documented smoke procedure and benchmark
protocol keep those separate from static/native installer checks.

### Release and cleanup — complete

The audit goal is complete. Under subsequent user authorization,
[v0.3.1](https://github.com/snaplyze/codex-orchestrator/releases/tag/v0.3.1)
was published from main at `e59b3b47e276736cb30ca078183388564cdd967e`.
CI passed for both
[main](https://github.com/snaplyze/codex-orchestrator/actions/runs/36239127982)
and the [tag](https://github.com/snaplyze/codex-orchestrator/actions/runs/36239128047).
The release notes match the versioned CHANGELOG.md section. The merged working
branch was deleted locally and on GitHub; only main remains. This follow-up did
not reopen the audit or add implementation scope. Use current Git, release and
native goal state when resuming; do not create a duplicate audit goal.

## Subscription-profile update — 2026-09-30

This is a separately authorized update after the completed audit, based on
`63dc1008bde7bca0d4435753756e96399338b57f`. The user approved the researched
Sol 6.1/Luna design and requested Pro 100/200/500 plus an updated Plus profile.
The audit's historical restrictions and outcomes above are not reopened.

### Initial scope and acceptance (superseded for Plus root effort below)

- Canonical Pro 100/200/500: Sol 6.1 medium root, worker/tester/reviewer;
  Luna high explorer/researcher and generic children; child caps 2/3/4.
- Plus: Luna high root and execution, Sol 6.1 medium reviewer, child cap 2.
- Standard speed in every bundle, unchanged permission defaults and five roles.
- Both installers select all four canonical bundles; legacy names and directories
  remain compatible copies. Numeric choices 3/4 change to Pro 200/500 and are
  explicitly documented for automation migration.
- One shared skill supports economy/normal/thorough routing, cumulative
  delegation checks, bounded briefs and honest handling of stale/unknown quota.
  These are instructions, not an automatic quota controller or new TOML keys.
- Keep installer transaction/rollback behavior, user files, historical releases,
  the usage-report schema and installed global settings unchanged.

### Verification checkpoint

Implementation and documentation are complete in the working tree. Independent
review found no material defects in profiles, aliases, installer selection,
permissions, shared policy or migration documentation. No commit or publication
was performed.

- Profile tests were updated first and failed on the missing/new topology, then
  passed after implementation. Installer selection tests likewise passed after
  the menu/bundle update.
- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -v`: 58 tests passed
  on Linux with the shell installer, zero skips.
- `sh -n setup.sh`, `shellcheck setup.sh`, and `git diff --check`: passed.
- All local file links in 13 documents resolve; eight TOML examples parse.
- `skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py`: passed for the shared skill using
  PyYAML 6.0.3 in a disposable virtual environment (removed after validation).
  The host Python lacks PyYAML; no dependency was added to this repository or
  installed globally. Profile checks verify all seven skill copies are identical.
- Independent reviewer re-ran the profile suite: four tests passed. Installer
  transaction/rollback code was unchanged; PowerShell received static review.
- Policy tabletop probes covered eight routine edits with a two-child cap,
  economy mode on authorization code, and Pro 500 with a stale quota snapshot.
  The baseline lacked explicit mode/speed/quota rules. After the update the
  independent reader retained required review/tests, grouped routine work,
  kept Standard absent an explicit override, and marked stale quota unknown.
  This is instruction interpretation, not live agent execution or billing proof.

Current CLI: 0.159.2. PowerShell is not installed on this host; fresh Windows,
macOS, account-access, and Codex role/skill-discovery runs are unverified. No
paid quality/usage benchmark or global installation was performed. Historical

## Documentation review and v0.4.0 release — 2026-09-30

The user explicitly authorized a complete documentation review, corrections,
push, tag and GitHub release. They confirmed **Plus root Luna max, children
high**. This supersedes the same-day initial high-root checkpoint above.
Pro 100/200/500 retain Sol 6.1 medium with 2/3/4 child caps.

### Review corrections

- Updated Plus root and compatibility copy, tests, README, all current guides
  and release notes; kept the optional routine root-high preset clearly separate.
- Clarified that installer bundles are not native Codex `--profile` entries;
  added post-install launch/trust checks and examples of skill, role and mode use.
- Specified custom-role model/effort precedence and that active permission
  overrides can replace role sandbox defaults; preserved no-write role policy.
- Corrected the bounded-delegation example to include mode, external authority,
  acceptance and stop conditions; synchronized all seven skills.
- Updated the forward-looking release pin to v0.4.0, made old-skill migration
  conditional, and clarified the target-placement instruction versus the
  installer's exact-path guard. Historical release evidence remains historical.
- Rechecked official sources. The live Pricing page says Pro has no five-hour
  limit while Help Center's usage guide retains an older Pro 5x/20x table. The
  model guide now records this discrepancy and defers to actual account windows.

### Release verification

- The Plus root-max regression failed against the old configuration, then passed
  after changing both Plus bundles. All 58 local tests passed with zero skips;
  shell syntax, ShellCheck and `git diff --check` passed.
- Independent follow-up review found no material issues. File links in 20
  Markdown documents resolve and eight TOML examples parse. Bundle-path tests
  use POSIX normalization so their expectations are portable to Windows.
- Codex CLI 0.159.2 smoke checks installed all four bundles into disposable Git
  projects. `skills/list` discovered each local skill enabled with no errors;
  `model/list` advertised Luna max and Sol 6.1 medium support. No inference ran.
- Effective project configuration and runtime role parsing remain unverified:
  `config/read` disabled the untrusted project layers, and a per-process trust
  override did not enable them. Global trust/configuration was not modified.
  Skill discovery and model metadata do not prove account inference access.
- Native four-platform CI and publication are pending at this checkpoint; the
  release will link the successful runs for its commit. No paid quality/usage
  benchmark or global installation was performed. Prior releases are unchanged.
